Sup, I'm zoey, I go by many names(julie, and scott to name a few)  
I'm a trans woman(<sarcasm>trans woman programmer, very rare i know</sarcasm>), pronouns are she/they
I mainly just work on my discord bot nowadays, although I do have a website, I haven't had the time to work on it with the discord bot and (believe it or not) non-programming work
If you ever wanna talk to me, I'm on discord at Julie Pilgrim#3328
